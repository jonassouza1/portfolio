          <h2>Fullstack Web Developer</h2>
          <p>
            With lines of code as brushes, I design the future of the web.
            Frontend that delights, backend that surprises. Transforming ideas
            into experiences, I am the digital architect who builds bridges
            between dreams and reality.

            <p>
              I embarked on this journey in October 2022, converting ideas into
              digital reality. From code conception to final product, I build
              experiences that stand out. My trajectory is marked by constant
              evolution, guided by the incessant search for new challenges and
              innovations.
